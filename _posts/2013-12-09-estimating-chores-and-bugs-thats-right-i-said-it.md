The Agile purist in me completely agrees that there's something wrong with estimating chores and bugs. After all, these two "story types" don't contribute value directly to the customer. So why do we do them? Well in theory, if we don't our "velocity" will slowly decay over time. So in effect, we're paying down our "debt".

So I get that chores and bugs shouldn't contribute to velocity, but I still find it useful to estimate them. Especially when they are large. Some refactors need to be estimated so we can all have an intelligent converation about the cost/benefit tradeoff in implementing the chore.
